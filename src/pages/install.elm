## Upgrade / Uninstall

To upgrade to a newer version of Elm, run the installer again. They displace
old executables so your machine is in a consistent state.

The Windows installer comes bundled with an uninstall option. To uninstall on
Mac, run [this script][uninstall]. If you built from source, delete everything
and change your PATH so that it no longer refers to those executables.
